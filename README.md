Knowledge Base Bridge - Entity linking system

A state of the art entity linking system used by UMass in the TAC KBP english entity link task.

It uses a search index of Wikipedia and a supervised learning to rank system built upon the RankLib package.

More detailed documentation on installing and running KbBridge will be available shortly.

For help, you can contact the authors: jdalton@cs.umass.edu for assistance with the code and access to our search index.
